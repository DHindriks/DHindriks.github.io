	<h3>Gameplay</h3>
	<img src="../images/RRekenappLvl1.png" width="75%" align="middle">
	<p>There are 3 levels in the game, all levels function the same but have a different theme.<br>
	at the start of a level, a randomly generated sum will appear on screen, shortly after, five answers will fly from one side of the screen to the other.<br>
	At least one of these answers is correct, the player needs to tap on that answer before it goes off-screen again.<br>
	If the player runs out of time or taps on te wrong answer, one of the 5 lives will be lost, the loses the level when there are no lives left.<br>
	The player needs to answer around 15 sums correctly to win the level, the player will move further in the level after answering a few sums correctly.<br> 
	</p>
	
	<h3>Levels</h3>
