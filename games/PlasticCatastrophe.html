	<p>
		There are 3 different animal species in the game that the player can switch between: the turtle, seal and seagull.<br>
		Each character has its own minigame that the player needs to complete in order to pick up trash items. Players will earn the trash item and XP points for the selected animal by successfully completing the minigames.<br>
		switching between the different animals is encouraged, animals will gain more XP from picking up trash that is dangerous to their species. Each animal also has limited amounts of energy, characters with low energy can't pick up more trash and will need time to rest.
