	<h1>Space Arena</h1>
	<h4>An arcade shooter where the player takes control of a small fighter ship, the goal is to get the highest score and survive as long as possible.</h4>
	<br>
	<h3>Gameplay</h3>
	<p>The player can see the highest score and the name of the player who made it in the main menu.</p>

	<p>The game itself takes place near an enemy space station, the debris around the station can be used as cover against enemy fire. <br>
	Debris can be pushed too, destroying an enemy with debris will award double points, pushing debris will cause damage to the player as well</p>
	<br>
	<h3>Health and shields</h3>
	<img src="../images/SBSIngame.png" width="75%" align="middle">
	<p>The player has a health bar and a shield bar. the shield bar will go down when the player takes damage and regenerate after not taking damage for a few seconds. <br>
	The health bar will go down if the player takes damage without any shield left. When all health is lost, the player's ship will explode.<br>
	After exploding, a game over screen will show up, the player can return to the main menu from here, if the player achieved a high score, a name can be chosen to be displayed in the main menu.</p>

	<p>Lost health can still be restored, using an active heal station will restore the player's health bar back to max.<br>
	Heal stations can be found at set locations around the arena, but most are inactive.<br>
	there are always 2 active heal stations in the arena, if the player uses one, an inactive heal station will be randomly chosen and activated.</p>
	<br>
	<h3>Enemies and combat</h3>
	<p>One of the first AI's I've created, each enemy is spawned with randomized values for: dodging distance, health, speed and attack cooldown.<br>
	Enemies do not have regenerating shields, they often spawn with more health than the player and will be destroyed in 2 to 5 hits.</p>
