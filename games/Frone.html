	<h3>Project</h3>
	<img src="../images/FroneMission.png" width="75%" align="middle">
	<p>Frone is probably my biggest project, with different areas, drone customisation, factions to support and more.<br>
	This game is still in development, there are still a lot of placeholder models.</p>
	<br>
	<h3>Gameplay</h3>
	<img src="../images/FroneShoot.png" width="75%" align="middle">
	<p>The player can walk around in a first-person hub world, the hangar. The hangar is the base of operations, this is where the player can craft blueprints and materials, contact NPC factions, start missions and in a future update: place decorations.<br>
	There are a few mission types, patrol is probably the most basic mission type: the player needs to fly through the area and reach the end of the level.<br>
	There are different items in the game that can be picked up, some items are common and found in most areas of the game, while others can only be found in certain missions areas or as drops from certain enemies.

	<h3>Drones and customisation</h3>
