	<p>My name is DaniÃ«l Hindriks, welcome to my portfolio.<br>
	I am a game developer from Groningen, the Netherlands.<br>
	I've always had interest in video games, regardless of genre or platform. It became clear to me pretty early on, that I want to work in that field.<br><br>
	On the projects page, you'll find some of the projects I've been working on.<br>
	Some of my code, including some old prototypes in C++ and Actionscript can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/DHindriks">Github</a>.<br>
	I am currently searching for job opportunities.</p>
