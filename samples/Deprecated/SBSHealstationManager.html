<h3>Script function</h3>
<p>This script manages the healstations that appear in the arena.<br>
The healstations are always in the same places, but only 2 will be active at a time.<br>
At the start of the game, the manager picks 2 stations to activate. Every time the player uses one, another one is randomly picked with tge Getstations() function.<br></p>
<h3>Challenges I encountered</h3>
<p>The manager picks a random station when one is used, it was possible for the manager to pick the station that was just used by the player.<br>
It would be a bit too easy for the player to immediately know where the active healstation is, I added a "skip" boolean to all stations, which are set to true when the stations are activated.<br>
When a station is used the skip boolean will stay on true until a new station is chosen, this will make sure that the last used station doesn't have a chance to reactivate immediately. </p>
